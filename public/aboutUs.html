        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to [group name] - a Volunteer Organization from The University of Adelaide team, dedicated to helping students get along well with campus life.</p>
        <h2>Why Volunteer?</h2>
        <p>We may not solve world hunger immediately, but we're convinced that by serving with each other in our local communities, we're paving the way for much broader
        changes. Our individual efforts don't need to be huge—a little bit of change here, a few hours there—but even small efforts quickly add up to make a real difference.
        <br>
        As we work side-by-side and learn from each other, mutual understanding increases, misconceptions can be corrected, and new friendships are built.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Our mission is to provide support and resources to ensure that students have a positive and enriching experience during their time at the University of Adelaide.</p>
